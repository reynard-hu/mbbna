# Multi-Band Brain Network Analysis for Functional Neuroimaging Biomarker Identification


## Objfun_slide_LDA5
this is the objective function file and it outputs a matirx which considers the important information between the features for fMRI data, which hopes each region can close to its neighbors from the same class and far away from its furthest neighbors.


## Objfun_slide_LDA5_testing
this file provide the final test for semi-supervised applications.

## Other files provide the necessary support for the final experiments.
