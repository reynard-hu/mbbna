# Multi-Band Brain Network Analysis for Functional Neuroimaging Biomarker Identification


## Objfun_slide_LDA5
This is the main objective function file and it outputs a matirx which considers the important information between the features for fMRI data, which hopes each region can be close to its neighbors from the same class and be far away from its furthest neighbors.


## Objfun_slide_LDA5_testing
This file obtains the matrix type for all obtained Sm for all subjects.

## Example
This file provides the final test for semi-supervised applications.
